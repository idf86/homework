      <h1>Butterscotch Cinnamon Pie</h1>
      <p>Here's my recipe for butterscotch and cinnamon pie! It's rather sweet, but it is usually a hit at get-togethers.</p>
        <hr>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>CRUST</h3>
        <br>Mix the egg yolk, water, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl and set it aside.

        <br><br>For these next steps you can do it by hand, in an electric mixer fitted with a flat paddle attachment, or (my favorite way) with a food processor. Add the flour, sugar, and salt into your mixer of choice and then add the butter in pieces and pulse/mix/cut it in until the pieces are no larger than peas and the mixture resembles something like a rough cornmeal. Add in the egg mixture and mix until the dough pulls together.
        <br><br>Place the dough on a floured surface and pat it out with your hands into a disk-shape. Sprinkle a little flour on top of it and then use a rolling pin to roll it out to about 1/8 of an inch thick. Carefully drape it over a tart pan (I put a round of parchment paper in the bottom of mine just in case) and use a sharp knife to trim off the excess dough along the edges. Don’t worry if it tears or has holes - just use the trimmed dough to mend it. A tiny bit of water smoothed along the edges will help to blend them back together. Poke a couple of holes in the bottom with a fork and pop the crust into a 350 degree F oven for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden-brown. Remove and allow to cool completely before filling. You can put dried beans or pie weight in the bottom of the crust to keep the bottom from rising if you’re so inclined.</p>
        <hr>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>FILLING</h3>
        <br>In a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat add the sugar, flour, corn starch, and salt. Use a whisk to combine them and then slowly pour in the milk. Keeps mixing until it is fully combined and thickens, otherwise you might get lumps. This mixture MUST be thick, to the point of resembling a pudding or else it will not set firmly when you start to chill it.

        <br><br>In a small bowl, add a small amount of the hot butterscotch to the egg yolk and mix them together. This will keep the yolk from scrambling when you add it. Whisk the hot egg mixture into the butterscotch and then add the butter and vanilla. Mix until fully combined. Allow the butterscotch to cool before pouring it into the tart shell. If there is any remaining, I highly recommend you keep it to yourself and eat it with a spoon. Sharing is overrated. Refrigerate the pie until the butterscotch sets completely before topping.

        <br>Refrigerate the pie and let it cool for a few hours to make sure it sets.</p>
        <hr>
        <br><br>
        <p><h3>TOPPING</h3>
        <br>Add all ingredients into an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until the whipped cream forms stiff peaks. Dollop generously on top of the pie and sprinkle with a little additional cinnamon.</p>

      <h3>Extra</h3><hr>
      <p>I like to make my pie crust graham cracker flavoured. It meshes rather well with the sweet butterscotch.</p>
        <p>If there is extra whipped cream you can use it for other treats, like ice cream!</p>
